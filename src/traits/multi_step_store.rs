//! Storage trait for multi-step Open Responses orchestration.
//!
//! [`MultiStepStore`] is the storage half of the contract that
//! [`crate::run_response_loop`] drives. It owns:
//!
//! - the **transition function** ([`MultiStepStore::next_action_for`]) that
//!   decides what the next step is given the chain so far;
//! - **CRUD primitives** for persisting and updating step rows
//!   ([`record_step`](MultiStepStore::record_step) /
//!   [`mark_step_processing`](MultiStepStore::mark_step_processing) /
//!   [`complete_step`](MultiStepStore::complete_step) /
//!   [`fail_step`](MultiStepStore::fail_step));
//! - the **chain walk** ([`list_chain`](MultiStepStore::list_chain)) so the
//!   transition function can read state without coupling onwards to any
//!   particular storage backend's chain primitive;
//! - **assembly** ([`assemble_response`](MultiStepStore::assemble_response))
//!   from the chain to the final OpenAI Response JSON.
//!
//! Execution lives elsewhere — see [`super::StepExecutor`]. The split keeps
//! storage and execution independently mockable, and keeps onwards free of
//! tool-kind or storage-backend specifics.
//!
//! Implementing this trait is opt-in: consumers that don't need multi-step
//! support (legacy callers using only [`super::ResponseStore`]) don't need
//! to touch [`MultiStepStore`] at all.
