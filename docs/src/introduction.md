A Rust-based AI Gateway that provides a unified interface for routing requests to OpenAI-compatible targets. The goal is to be as "transparent" as possible.

## Features

- **Unified routing** to any OpenAI-compatible provider
- **Hot-reloading** configuration with automatic file watching
- **Authentication** with global and per-target API keys
- **Rate limiting** per-target and per-API-key with token bucket algorithm
- **Concurrency limiting** per-target and per-API-key
- **Load balancing** with weighted random and priority strategies
- **Automatic failover** across multiple providers
- **Response sanitization** for strict OpenAI schema compliance
- **Prometheus metrics** for monitoring
- **Custom response headers** for pricing and metadata
- **Upstream auth customization** for non-standard providers
