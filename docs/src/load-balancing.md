# Load Balancing

Onwards supports load balancing across multiple providers for a single alias, with automatic failover, weighted distribution, and configurable retry behavior.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "gpt-4": {
      "strategy": "weighted_random",
      "fallback": {
        "enabled": true,
        "on_status": [429, 5],
        "on_rate_limit": true
      },
      "providers": [
        { "url": "https://api.openai.com", "onwards_key": "sk-key-1", "weight": 3 },
        { "url": "https://api.openai.com", "onwards_key": "sk-key-2", "weight": 1 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Strategy

- **`weighted_random`** (default): Distributes traffic randomly based on weights. A provider with `weight: 3` receives ~3x the traffic of `weight: 1`.
- **`priority`**: Always routes to the first provider. Falls through to subsequent providers only when fallback is triggered.

## Fallback

Controls automatic retry on other providers when requests fail:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Master switch for fallback |
| `on_status` | int[] | -- | Status codes that trigger fallback (supports wildcards) |
| `on_rate_limit` | bool | `false` | Fallback when hitting local rate limits |
| `with_replacement` | bool | `false` | For `weighted_random`, allow a provider to be selected again |
| `max_attempts` | int? | provider count | Maximum pre-response failover attempts |
| `backoff` | object? | `null` | Delay between attempts; no delay when omitted |
| `max_total_backoff_ms` | int? | `null` | Maximum cumulative time spent sleeping between attempts |
| `stream_continuation` | object? | `null` | Best-effort continuation for eligible interrupted completion streams |

Status code wildcards:

- `5` matches all 5xx (500-599)
- `50` matches 500-509
- `502` matches exact 502

When fallback triggers, the next provider is selected based on strategy (weighted random resamples from remaining pool; priority uses definition order).

### Stream continuation

Stream continuation is opt-in and applies only to eligible `POST /v1/completions`
streams. It forwards the already emitted text to another provider when the
initial provider stops before sending a terminal event. The prefix is kept in
memory for the lifetime of the request; it is not persisted and is lost if the
process restarts. The output is best-effort: an interruption or exhausted
continuation budget can leave the client with a partial stream, and the proxy
does not synthesize a `[DONE]` event after exhaustion.

Configure it inside `fallback`:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "gpt-4-instruct": {
      "fallback": {
        "enabled": true,
        "on_status": [429, 5],
        "on_rate_limit": true,
        "stream_continuation": {
          "enabled": true,
          "endpoints": ["/v1/completions"],
          "max_attempts": 1,
          "max_buffered_bytes": 1048576,
          "idle_timeout_ms": 30000
        }
      },
      "providers": [
        { "url": "https://primary.example.com", "onwards_key": "sk-primary" },
        { "url": "https://backup.example.com", "onwards_key": "sk-backup" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enables continuation, subject to the parent `fallback.enabled` switch |
| `endpoints` | string[] | `[]` | Exact request paths eligible for continuation; use `["/v1/completions"]` only |
| `max_attempts` | int | `1` | Fresh post-commit continuation-attempt budget |
| `max_buffered_bytes` | int | `1048576` | Maximum generated-text bytes retained for a continuation request |
| `idle_timeout_ms` | int? | `null` | Maximum idle time between upstream stream events; `null` disables this timeout |

`fallback.max_attempts` controls failover before the response starts and its
headers are committed. `stream_continuation.max_attempts` is a separate, fresh
budget after a successful stream has committed its response. Continuation
reuses the parent fallback status matching, local rate-limit behavior, provider
selection, request/header handling, and backoff settings, including
`max_total_backoff_ms`.

Only a narrow completion shape is supported: a string `prompt`, `stream: true`,
`n` omitted or `1`, and `echo` omitted or `false`. Chat and Responses requests,
tool-calling streams, structured-output streams, multi-choice requests, prompt
token-array requests, and `echo: true` are unsupported and pass through without
continuation. The upstream response must be a successful response with the
exact `text/event-stream` media type (case-insensitive; parameters are allowed)
and no content encoding or `Content-Encoding: identity`. An encoded stream is
left untouched; an encoded or non-SSE continuation response is rejected rather
than spliced into the client stream.

The buffer cap is measured in UTF-8 bytes. Once appending a recognized text
chunk would exceed the cap, continuation is disabled for that request and the
overflow text is not retained. `idle_timeout_ms` applies between upstream
events and treats an idle stream as interrupted. Final usage is forwarded from
the provider that supplies the terminal stream; it is not aggregate usage or
aggregate billing across the initial and continuation providers.

## Pool-level options

Settings that apply to the entire alias:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `keys` | Access control keys for this alias |
| `rate_limit` | Rate limit for all requests to this alias |
| `concurrency_limit` | Max concurrent requests to this alias |
| `response_headers` | Headers added to all responses |
| `strategy` | `weighted_random` or `priority` |
| `fallback` | Retry configuration (see above) |
| `providers` | Array of provider configurations |

## Provider-level options

Settings specific to each provider:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `url` | Provider endpoint URL |
| `onwards_key` | API key for this provider |
| `onwards_model` | Model name override |
| `weight` | Traffic weight (default: 1) |
| `rate_limit` | Provider-specific rate limit |
| `concurrency_limit` | Provider-specific concurrency limit |
| `response_headers` | Provider-specific headers |
| `trusted` | Override pool-level trust for strict mode error sanitization (`true`/`false`; omit to inherit from pool) |
| `propagate_trace_context` | Whether to inject W3C `traceparent` / `tracestate` headers on outbound requests to this provider (`true`/`false`; omit to inherit from the resolved `trusted` value). Useful for preventing trace IDs from leaking to third-party providers whose downstream HTTP fetches would re-emit them. See [Trace context propagation](#trace-context-propagation) below. |

## Trace context propagation

`onwards` forwards W3C trace context (`traceparent` and `tracestate`
headers) on outbound requests to upstream providers, so a downstream
service that participates in your distributed tracing fabric can stitch
its spans into the calling trace.

Whether the headers are sent is controlled by `propagate_trace_context`:

- `propagate_trace_context: true` — always propagate
- `propagate_trace_context: false` — never propagate
- *omitted* (default) — inherit from the resolved `trusted` value:
  - per-provider `trusted: true|false` overrides
  - falling back to the pool-level `trusted` (default `false`)

In effect: **trusted upstreams receive trace context by default;
untrusted upstreams do not**. This prevents trace IDs from leaking to
third-party services that may re-emit them on their own outbound
calls (e.g., a provider's image fetcher echoing your `traceparent`
back to whatever URL the caller supplied).

> **Migration note.** Prior to onwards v0.28, `traceparent` was
> propagated to every upstream unconditionally. After this change,
> non-trusted upstreams no longer propagate by default (and any inbound
> trace context is stripped before forwarding to them). If you rely on
> trace continuity across `onwards → upstream` and the upstream isn't
> marked `trusted: true`, set `propagate_trace_context: true` on that
> provider. The field is **provider-scoped**: set it on each relevant
> entry of a pool's `providers` array, or on a legacy single-provider
> target. There is no pool-level `propagate_trace_context` key — for a
> whole pool, mark the pool `trusted: true` (which both bypasses
> error sanitization and enables propagation) or set the field on each
> provider entry.

## Examples

### Primary/backup failover

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "gpt-4": {
      "strategy": "priority",
      "fallback": { "enabled": true, "on_status": [5], "on_rate_limit": true },
      "providers": [
        { "url": "https://primary.example.com", "onwards_key": "sk-primary" },
        { "url": "https://backup.example.com", "onwards_key": "sk-backup" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple API keys with pool-level rate limit

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "gpt-4": {
      "rate_limit": { "requests_per_second": 100, "burst_size": 200 },
      "providers": [
        { "url": "https://api.openai.com", "onwards_key": "sk-key-1" },
        { "url": "https://api.openai.com", "onwards_key": "sk-key-2" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Backwards compatibility

Single-provider configs still work unchanged:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "gpt-4": {
      "url": "https://api.openai.com",
      "onwards_key": "sk-key"
    }
  }
}
```
